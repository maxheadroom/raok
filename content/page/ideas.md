# Ideas & Inspiration
## Donuts
Just bring a small box of donuts and give it to someone you'd like to be kind to.

## Flowers
Buy some flowers and place them on your colleagues desks.

## Coffee
Every morning you see the volunteer parents guarding the kids across the street in front of the school. How about bringing them a coffee?
