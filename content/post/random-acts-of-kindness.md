# Be good
We believe that random acts of kindness can make the world a better place. Often times a tiny effort can enlighten the day of a person and make her smile.
That smile in turn can make other people happy. Kindness and happiness can be contagious.
Random, unconditional acts of kindness will spread like seeds of happiness.
