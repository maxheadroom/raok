# Be good
We believe that random acts of kindness can make the world a better place. Often times a tiny effort can enlight the day of a person and make her smile.
That smile in turn can make other people happy. Kindness and happyness can be contagious.
Random, unsolicitated acts of kindness will spread like seeds of hapiness.
